# paramJS
Simple 3D engine to render wireframe objects using Mathematical Parameterizations input from the user

This "engine" was written from scratch in javascript and the canvas API somewhere in mid 2014 
and is uploaded here as-is with typos and okay-ish code 

I wrote this originally to help me visualize these methods studying for my CS degree 

you can clone this at your own risk the code is old and not maintained, but it helped me understand the math

it uses polish-notation to convert math string into actual javascript methods that can be rendered to the screen
