# paramJS
A 3d engine to display 3d objects from 1 parameter or 2 parameter functions
This "engine" was written from scratch in javascript and the canvas API somewhere in mid 2014 
and is uploaded here as-is with typos and okay-ish code 

I wrote this originally to help me visualize these methods studying for sjdiao  my CS degree 

you can clone this at you're own risk the code it old and not maintained
